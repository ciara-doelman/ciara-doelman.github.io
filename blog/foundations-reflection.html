    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?

    </h2>
    <div class="inner-container">
      <p>
        Being empathetic and practicing self-awareness is essential in learning and programming.          
        <span class="read-more-text">
          Working on these values and being strong in these areas make you a way better person to be around and work with (whether you’re working alone or with others). On the flip side, someone who’s not empathetic or very aware of what they are like would be a massive pain to work with. 
          <br><br>
          And it’s not just about making working more enjoyable, I believe you get better at learning and working if you practice self-awareness and empathy towards yourself. Knowing where you need to grow without getting mad at yourself for it will help you grow much faster.

      <p>How valuable I found it to go back over concepts that were familiar to me.

          Even though I understand a lot of this stuff at the intellectual level, actually experiencing it and working through it requires constant work.

      <p>
        Making a learning plan.
        <span class="read-more-text">
          I have always considered myself pretty good at 
          learning, but learning how to learn in different 
          ways and discovering my shortcomings when it comes 
          to learning was a challenge. But I think it was a 
          welcome one!

    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?

    </h2>
    <div class="inner-container">
      <p>
        Because regardless of what you define as “success”, having core skills will help you get there.

    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.

      <p>
        Nah - taking the time to reflect and hone how I learn ultimately SAVES time.
