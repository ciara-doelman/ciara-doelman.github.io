      <h2>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people:
      </h2>
      <div class="inner-container">
        <p>
          People who think that the brain is fixed assume that talent is an inherent trait 
          and that they will never become good at the things that they currently struggle 
          with.         
          <span class="read-more-text">
          Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity helps you realise that you have 
          the power to change your brain if you want to, therefore you can learn and 
          accomplish a lot more than you think!

      <h2>How I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit:
      </h2>
      <div class="inner-container">
        <p>
          Remembering that intensity and the hard parts are actually the points
           where I am learning the most.        
          <span class="read-more-text">
            Just because I struggle with something now doesn’t mean I always will & I will actually
           learn faster/more effectively if I recognise that I WILL know the thing at some point.

      <h2>What are some ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
      </h2>
      <div class="inner-container">
        <ul class="normal-font">
         <li>Meditation: teaches you to notice when your brain is going down the same 
          pathways and helps reset the brain.</li>
  
          <span class="read-more-text">
            <li>Exercises such as goal setting, self-reflection, etc.
            </li>
            <li>Growth mindset.</li>
            <li>Surrounding yourself with people who inspire/motivate you.
            </li>
            <li>Taking care of your physical health (exercise, sleep).
            </li>
            <li>Learning & practicing new things, e.g. music, art, coding ;), 
              reading a book on an unfamiliar topic, a different language.
            </li>
            <li>Not to be That Guy (I’m not a guy anyway) but psychedelics - under careful conditions,
               like with a spiritual guide or clinician & obviously in places where that is legal.
