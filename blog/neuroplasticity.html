      </h2>

        <p>
          People who think that the brain is fixed assume that talent is an inherent trait 
          and that they will never become good at the things that they currently struggle 
          with.         
          <span class="read-more-text">
          Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity helps you realise that you have 
          the power to change your brain if you want to, therefore you can learn and 
          accomplish a lot more than you think!

          Remembering that intensity and the hard parts are actually the points

            Just because I struggle with something now doesn’t mean I always will & I will actually
           learn faster/more effectively if I recognise that I WILL know the thing at some point.

            <li>Not to be That Guy (I’m not a guy anyway) but psychedelics - under careful conditions,

      <h2>What is a growth mindset?
      </h2>
      <div class="inner-container">
        <p>
          I see a growth mindset as something closely linked to neuroplasticity.       
          <span class="read-more-text">
            A growth mindset is where you consciously maintain an attitude
             that your skill, talent, and capacity can change/improve over time. 
             <br>
             <br>

              It is SUPER relevant because we are doing this tricky AS course where 
              not everybody has experience with coding or is that into problem solving. 
              Instead of feeling stink about being in that position, anyone with a growth 
              mindset will do really well in this course. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Growth mindsets are awesome beyond the scope of this course as well. 
              Knowing how much we can learn and achieve over time will take us all super 
              far in whatever areas we choose. Yaass.

      <h2>Has anything surprised me or changed for me?
      </h2>
      <div class="inner-container">
        <p>
          I saw a few comments in my research around how our beliefs about ourselves impact the people around us
           - especially if you’re a teacher/trying to help someone learn something.          
          <span class="read-more-text">
            I don’t think it really surprised me but it resonates a lot.
             <br>
             <br>

             Also something that I already “knew” but the reminder is always welcome: 
             mistakes are not a sign of failure, they are the best opportunities to learn.

      <h2>How will I integrate growth mindset in my learning journey?
      </h2>
      <div class="inner-container">
        <p>
          I am one of those people who, when I have my Fixed Mindset Hat on, assumes that I
           am learning best when I am perfect at things straight away.         
          <span class="read-more-text">
            Which makes it frustrating when I hit parts that are new. A growth mindset will
             help me a lot in recognising how the hard parts are the BEST parts.

        What I have learned about neuroplasticity and the growth mindset will strengthen my

          It will be good to maintain exercises that keep my neuroplasticity nice and
