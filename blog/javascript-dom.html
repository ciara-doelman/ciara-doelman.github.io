      <div>
        <p>Picture your website as a house. You start with a foundation, a bunch of walls, a roof, windows, doorways, and whatever else you need for a sound structure. That's your HTML.</p>
       <p>You go into your house and think, ew. Ugly. So you add some curtains, carpet, art, and plants. Maybe a couch and a bed. Way nicer. That's your CSS.</p>
       <p>Then you think, wow this house is nice but I can't really do a lot in here. So you put in all your furniture, tools, and appliances: your heating system, your fridge, your lights, phone, and coffee machine. That's JavaScript.</p>
       <p>Basically, HTML is your website's foundation, CSS is its deco, and JavaScript is its functionality and Pizzazz.</p>

        <p>Control flow: in JavaScript is the flow your computer runs through when reading code. Starting from the top of the code and ending at the bottom, your computer follows each statement and only changes what the control flow does when it hits a statement (e.g. a function) that changes it.</p>
        <p>Loops: are statements that keep running until </p>
