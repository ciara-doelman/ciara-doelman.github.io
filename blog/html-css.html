    <h1>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h1>
<div>
  <p>There are many ways to position elements in web design, and it is super important to understand the difference between the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Relative</li>
    <li>Absolute</li>
    <li>Fixed</li>
  </ul>
<p>Unlike with Photoshop or Word or Paint or any other kind of editor you might be used to, you canâ€™t just click and drag elements on your webpage when using CSS. Instead, you have to tell your code editor which TYPE of position you want and then define HOW.
</p>
<p>So, first of all, here is a screenshot of a table on my blog homepage, currently with zero positioning changes made to it:
